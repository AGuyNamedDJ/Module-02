    <h1>Saturday Chicken Stock</h1>
    <div>
      This is not a quick recipe, but the results are worth it. I usually take
      an entire Saturday to make this, but most of the time it's simmering on
      the stove, so it's not labor intensive. Chicken bones browned with celery,
      onions and carrots make this broth dark and rich. I freeze leftover
      rotisserie chicken bones and make this about once a month or so. I freeze
      the stock in quart bags and use one whenever I would use chicken broth.
    </div>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      1 tablespoon olive oil
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 rotisserie chicken carcasses, broken into pieces
    </ul>
    <ul>
      4 carrots, cut into chunks
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 large onions, cut into chunks
    </ul>
    <ul>
      3 stalks celery, with leaves
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1/2 cup dry white wine
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 tablespoon whole peppercorns
    </ul>
    <ul>
      5 whole cloves
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 bay leaves
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 sprig fresh thyme
    </ul>
    <ul>
      5 quarts water
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Pour olive oil into the bottom of a roasting pan; top with chicken carcass
      pieces, carrots, onions, and celery.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionaly, until bones and
      vegetables are browned, about 1 hour.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Transfer roasted chicken bones and vegetables to an 8-quart stockpot. Pour
      wine into the roasting pan, scraping the bottom to release any browned
      bits of food; pour into stockpot. Add peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and
      thyme to stockpot. Cover the mixture with water and bring to a slow
      simmer. Set heat to low and simmer, straining off fat as needed, for at
      least 5 hours. Strain stock through a cheesecloth; refrigerate or freeze
      stock.
    </ol>
